<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Swine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Vaccine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Vaccine</li><li>Inactivated Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Swine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (SRRS) vaccine market offers two primary types: active and inactivated vaccines. Active vaccines utilize live attenuated viruses to stimulate a strong immune response, providing long-lasting protection. In contrast, inactivated vaccines contain killed viruses, which provide a safer option with fewer side effects, though they may require multiple doses for effective immunity. Both types are essential for controlling SRRS, impacting pig health and productivity within the swine industry.</p></p>
