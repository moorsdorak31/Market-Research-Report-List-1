<p><strong>The Spinal Thoracolumbar Implants Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Surgery</li><li>Minimally Invasive Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spinal thoracolumbar implants market is divided into applications for open surgery and minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Open surgery involves larger incisions and direct access to the spine, allowing for extensive correction of spinal deformities and stabilization. Conversely, MIS employs smaller incisions, reducing trauma and recovery time, making it increasingly popular for procedures like discectomies and fusions. The growing preference for less invasive techniques drives demand for implants designed for both surgical approaches, enhancing patient outcomes and satisfaction.</p></p>
